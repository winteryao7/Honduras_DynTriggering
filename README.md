# Honduras EQ
An old observation of dynamically triggered EQs within Tenorio Volcano

1. Try to play with DynTrig Python package 
2. How about measuring velocity change associated with magma movement?
3. Earthquake swarm migration

Updates Dec 27, 2021: 

a. Unable to recover many self-detection (Not sure what happened to the stacking)

b. Avoid using station II.JTS? (caused by different sampling rate). 

Updates Dec 30, 2021

1. Add -dr option when converting data using mseed2sac

Updates Jan 6, 2022

I realize that some issue exists when trying to merge SAC files for several stations. 
Hence, I switch to hourly continuous trace instead of daily. (able to recover most of the 
autodetections)
