# Honduras EQ
An old observation of dynamically triggered EQs within Tenorio Volcano

1. Try to play with DynTrig Python package 
2. How about measuring velocity change associated with magma movement?
3. Earthquake swarm migration

Updates Dec 27, 2021: 

a. Unable to recover many self-detection (Not sure what happened to the stacking)
b. Avoid using station II.JTS? (caused by different sampling rate).
